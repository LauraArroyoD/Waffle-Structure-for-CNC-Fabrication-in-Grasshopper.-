*Caption: Parametric geometry and its corresponding bi-directional rib decomposition.*

## Overview This Grasshopper tool handles the entire workflow: from generating **fully parametric base geometries** to their automated structural decomposition. The algorithm transforms complex forms into bi-directional rib structures (waffle systems) with integrated interlocking joints for CNC fabrication.
